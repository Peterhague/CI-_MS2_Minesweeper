<li>To be able to get in touch with Games Inc. and contact them with their feedback</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="user-experience">User Experience</h2>

<p>The website is primarily designed for use on mobile and tablet devices, with a simple, clean layout with plenty of white
space. It is anticipated that the site's users will largely be under 16 and will tend access it via such devices. Where
images and additional graphics have been added for larger screens, these have been deployed mainly to break up some of that
white space created by the additional pixels, and where the feel had slipped from 'clean' to slightly 'empty'.</p>
<p>The main goals of the user experience design are to make clear immediately that this is a website offering educational
 games and to tempt users to play the games.</p>
<p>The first goal is achieved via the simple title advertising the Games Inc brand, in a typical "pixel art" style that 
users recognise as part of the gaming design language, as well as the prominent welcome message. The second is via bright, strong colours and cartoony imagery,
 designed to be attractive to younger users in particular, and a very clear, pared-down navigation bar offering clear access
 to the various games.</p>

<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Existing users in target market</li>
    <li>Potential users in target market</li>
    <li>Parents and care providers of potential users</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-stories">User Stories</h3>
<p>
There are two main categories of user anticipated for the website: existing and potential players of the games, generally anticipated to be 14 and younger (henceforth "players"), and adults who would potentially recommend the site to children in their care (henceforth "responsible adults").

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The project's scope in its initial release is limited to the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation bar to allow users to navigate the site quickly and easily, with bold underlining to show them which page they are currently looking at.</li>
<li>A brightly coloured footer with links to the firm's social media presence.</li>
<li>A home page with a large and prominent welcome message, and a form encouraging users to contact the owners with their suggestions for future games. The form is validated by Javascript code and interfaces with the emailJS API, informing the owners
of the new message and automatically sending the user a response.</li>
<li>"Minesweeper" page with a version of the popular logic-based game, with 3 selectable difficulty levels. The page loads to a
colourful call to action to play the game. The pixel art title is decorated with different randomly coloured tiles to recall the 
appearance of a minsweeper grid, and to add vibrancy and contrast with the white space.</li>
<li>"Spelling Bee" page with a spelling contest game, with 3 selectable difficulty levels. This page accesses the Responsive 
Voice API, to "speak" the words that the user has to attempt to spell. The elements are arranged to resemble and old-fashioned
computer monitor, with the game's messages displayed as if they were the monitor's text. The whole page is decorated in a 
yellow and black "bee" aesthetic, as a pun on the spelling bee title.</li>
<li>"Guess the Flag" page with a game quizzing players on their knowledge of world flags. This page uses the Country Flags API
to access a library of flag images that is randomised and displayed on each click of the play button. Each flag has a user input
for the player to type their guess at each flag's country. The page uses a blue and green "globe" aesthetic to match the flags theme, and the title has a fun flags motif with miniature flags adorning its letters.</li>
<li>A custom 404 "page does not exist" error page, with an error message and a prominent link to return to the home page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Features considered for later releases:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A section on the homepage with news about upcoming projects.</li>
    <li>A custom version of the minesweeper game, with users able to select the number of rows and mines.</li>
    <li>A timer on the minesweeper game showing the seconds elapsed since the start of the game.</li>
    <li>The ability for users to sign up and log in, so they can keep track of their scores and look at live leaderboards.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>The general aesthetic is colourful, retro, pixel art. It is meant to evoke 1980s video games as well as provide lots of
strong colours to appeal to younger users.</p>

<p>This design language influences every element of the site, from the bold, "pixelalted" titles, to the simple and virbant footers, to the content of the games themselves. Almost all the colours on the website are bright and vividly contrasting with each other. Images are used sparingly, but where considered necessary to aid visual flow, have been chosen for their strong colours and cartoon aesthetic to sustain the overall appearance.</p>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

<p>In general colours were chosen for their vibrancy and their appeal to younger users, with the home page dominated by bright pinks and blues. The game pages have themed colour schemes, but always with an eye on the guiding vividness.</p>

<p>The Minesweeper page is largely dominated by the grid itself, which has a bright green checkered effect. This grid does not appear on load, but the call to action uses the same colours to keep the look consistent. The Spelling Bee page is entirely yellow and black, as a fun play on the "Bee" in the title. The Guess the Flags page similarly echoes the blue and green of Earth to tie in with its subject matter.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>Cairo from Google Fonts is used for most of the text on the website, as it seemed to mesh well with the retro style of much of the site, while itself being readable but still pleasantly informal. Roboto from Google Fonts is used for the answers in the Flags game as it used less screen space than Cairo while maintaining a similar aesthetic. Press Start 2P from Google Fonts was 
used for the "display" in the Spelling game, to give an old-fashioned monitor effect.</p>

<h3>Imagery</h3>

<p>The images on the website take the form of large icons on the homepage to represent the 3 available games. They were taken
from larger images and had their backgrounds removed with online software. There are also cartoons of Rodin's The Thinker statue to decorate the call to get in touch on the homepage, and to focus the user on the form. The images on the website do not form a major part of the aesthetic and are used for emphasis of the prevailing design language.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The website has fourteen features across five pages (including a 404 error page).</p>

<h3>Current Features</h3>

<h4>Feature 1: Pixel Art Header</h4>

<p>Every page has a bespoke title using the same basic html elements but with modified CSS via Javascript code.</p>

<p>The heading-container div contains ten rows of one hundred small divs, which when coloured were designed to resemble familiar 'blocky' pixellated graphics.
These divs are coloured differently on each page to make up the title, for example spelling out 'Spelling Bee' and coloured in yellow and black stripes to resemble a
bee. Each page has its own fun and bespoke design.</p>

<p>This design is meant to be colourful and irreverent, appealing to younger users, and evocative of computer games in general.</p>

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 14: as a site owner, I want players to understand what kind of games my website offers and to encourage them to try them.</p>
<p>User story 16: as a site owner, I want players to feel at home on the website and to be happy spending time there.</p>
<p>User story 17: as a site owner, I want the website to be attractive to younger users and keen gamers in particular.</p>
<p>User story 21, as a site owner, I want the games to be responsive to every kind of device.</p>

<h4>Feature 2: Navigation Bar for Desktop and Mobile</h4>

<p>Every page has a navigation bar designed to be easy to use and clearly separated from its surrounding elements.</p>

<p>To this end, a minimalist aesthetic has been employed, with no background colour, stark black type, and bold bright pink underlining for the current page.</p>

<p>For smaller screens, I chose to replace the wording with icons, but kept the basic layout rather than cluttering the design with a collapsible menu/burger-icon
combination. The colour scheme is maintained, as well as the distance from other elements. The pink underline is replaced with highlighting.</p>

<p>The navigation bar is easily accessible and almost always present on screen on both mobile and desktop, to facilitate good user experience and fast navigation.</p>

<p>User story 16: as a site owner, I want players to feel at home on the website and to be happy spending time there.</p>

<h4>Feature 3: Homepage Welcome Message</h4>

<p>The homepage features a prominent and very colourful welcome message, explaining to users what the site is for and inviting them to try its content.</p>

<p>It also prompts users to fill in the form below it if they have any suggestions for games they would like to play.</p>

<p>This is an easy and unmissable introduction to the site, easily digestible for younger users.</p>

<p>The main container is surrounded with decorative images that give visual representations of each of the games on offer. As well as being attractive, these
draw teh eye to the actual message. These images are foregone on smaller screens to keep the design clean.</p>

<p>User story 16, as a site owner, I want players to feel at home on the website and to be happy spending time there.</p>

<h4>Feature 4: Page Footer with Social Media Links</h4>

<p>Every page has a brightly coloured footer with links to Game Inc.'s social media pages.</p>

<p>Each page's footer is coloured differently to tie in with the visual language of its page. The design has deliberately been kept simple, bold, and uncluttered,
with no more information than necessary. The object is to attractively enclose the page's other content and push users towards the prominent social media links.</p>

<p>User story 14, as a site owner, I want responsible adults to feel assured that my website is a safe and rewarding place for yooung users to play, and to be happy to recommend it to them.</p>

<h4>Feature 5: Form for Submission of Users' Ideas</h4>

<p>The home page features a short form through which users can submit their suggestions for development of future games.</p>

<p>It has fields for first and last name, email address, and then a textarea for the ideas and suggestions themselves.
</p>

<p>The form calls the API emailJS to send an email to my account on submission of the form, and the emailJS template then also sends 
and automatic reply to the user, employing the details they entered where appropriate.</p>

<p>The form is validated with Javascript code, and only submits when all fields are populated, and when a correctly constituted email
address is entered in that field.</p>

<h4>Feature 6: Minesweeper Difficulty Selector</h4>

<p>The minesweeper game has a dropdown selector for three difficulty levels, prompted at the start of the game, and available at the top of the grid
throughout a round.</p>

<p>Each of the options has a predefined number of grid rows and mines, to increase or decrease the challenge as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Feature 7: Minesweeper Grid of Squares</h4>

<p>When users click on the Minesweeper "play" button, a grid of square-shaped divs is generated, with the size dependent on the
 difficulty selected.</p>

<p>The minesweeper grid size is dynamic to accommodate the difficulty selector, and adapts to all different screen sizes to display in full without scrolling.</p>

<p>The grid is styled to resemble a chekerboard/chess board, with alternate green and lighter green squares.</p>

<p>User story 21, as a site owner, I want the games to be responsive to every kind of device.</p>

<h4>Feature 8: Minesweeper Game</h4>

<p>Once a difficulty has been selected and the grid generated, the Minesweeper game is then ready to be played.</p>

<p>If the user left clicks on a square, the Javascript code will check if there is a 'mine' on that square, and if not, will run the code
to count how many mines are on the squares that surround it on the grid. It then displays that number as the square's visible content, therefore 
responding dynamically to user input. On mobile devices the click event becomes a touch event.</p>

<p>If the square that the user clicks on has squares surrounding it that contain zero mines, then the Javascript code calls a click method to 
automatically click on all of those squares, and to all subsequent squares that meet the same conditions. The player should therefore never
have to click on any square that displays "0" as its content.</p>

<p>If the user right clicks on a square, a 'flag' will be placed on that square, indicating that the user believes that a mine is on that square.
The square's responsiveness is then changed: it can no longer be left clicked on to elicit a repsonse. If the user right clicks on a square that already
contains a flag, the flag will be removed and the square returned to its original state. Hence, the right click acts as a flag on/off toggle. On mobile devices
the event is instead triggered by a long touch, of more than 300 milliseconds.</p>

<p>User story 21, as a site owner, I want the games to be responsive to every kind of device.</p>

<h4>Feature 9: Minesweeper End Games Sequences</h4>

<p>The Minesweeper game has two end of game sequences to feedback to the user and give them confirmation of their performance. One if the player
clicks on a mined square and 'loses', another if the user manages to click on every unmined square, and 'wins'.</p>

<p>The losing sequence consists of every square on the grid changing colour to either white, grey or black, randomly but in equal parts, one after another but
in random order. The mined squares change their color property to red so their location can be seen. Finally the whole grid changes to black and every
square has the 'skull' font awesome icon displayed, to clearly indicate the failure state!</p>

<p>The winning sequence works very similarly, but with bright colours and a joyful, 'laughing' emoji icon, again to clearly feed back to the player that
they have 'won' the game.</p>

<h4>Feature 10: Spelling Bee Game Difficulty Selector</h4>

<p>The user is presented with a drop down selector with four difficulty levels to choose between before they click on the play button.</p>

<p>Depending on the difficulty selected, the game will generate a random selection of ten words to test the user with from one of four
dictionaries of 200 words. These words then form the content of the quiz.</p>

<p>User story 20, as a site owner, I want games that are suitable for a range of ages and ability levels.</p>

<h4>Feature 11: Spelling Bee Game</h4>

<p>Once the difficulty has been selected, a click on the play button will generate a random array of ten words from the relevant dictionary,
and via a call to the Responsive Voice API, the device will enunciate the first word in the array.</p>

<p>The page focus is then assigned to the user input element, prompting the user to attempt to spell the word.</p>

<p>When the user either clicks on the Submit button or presses the Return key, the Javascript code checks the value of the input
against the spelling stored in the variable. If the strings are identical (the code converts the user's input to lower case) the game's display
element presents "correct!", and if not it presents "incorrect!".</p>

<p>After a brief pause, the display then shows the subsequent question number, and the Responsive Voice API is called again to speak the next
word in the array. This process repeats until all the words have been spoken to the user.</p>

<p>After the tenth submission, and the display has presented either correct or incorrect, the display then presents the user's final score.</p>

<h4>Feature 12: Spelling Bee Game Repeat and Hint Functions</h4>

<p>The Spelling Bee game features Repeat and Hint buttons.</p>

<p>The Repeat button makes a call to the Responsive Voice API and repeats the current question to the user.</p>

<p>The Hint button presents the answer to the user as the content of the game display element, but with every other letter
replaced with an asterisk. The fact that the player has asked for a hint is stored in the variable, so that if the user 
subsequently submits a correct answer, only 0.5 points are added to their total score, rather than 1 point.</p>

<h4>Feature 13: Guess the Flags Game</h4>

<p>The Guess the Flags game presents an array of ten randomly selected images of national flags from the Country Flags API.</p>

<p>On each click of the play button the array will be repopulated at random.</p>

<p>Each of the ten flags displayed is accompanied by a text input element for the user to offer their attempt at naming
the nation to which the flag belongs.</p>

<p>On clicking the submit button, the input elements are replaced with divs displaying either a tick icon for a correct answer or
a cross icon for an incorrect answer. A message below the buttons also displays the user's score and an adaptive message depending on
how well they did. The submit button also changes to a reveal button, and if that is clicked any crosses will be 
replaced by the correct answer.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Tests performed:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Page links in the navigation bar work as advertised, all links work correctly in the static navbar and the collapsible mobile configuration.</li>
<li>The testimonials carousel displays appropriately, and the indicators are visible and work correctly.</li>
<li>The news stories open in modals as intended, with no scrolling on larger screens and full screen display and scrolling on mobile. The "top of page" arrow button works correctly on these devices, and the close button dismisses the modal.</li>
<li>The "Sign In" modal opens up correctly closes on a click outside the content or the cross button. The "forgotten details" link opens the subsequent modal and closes the first, as intended.</li>
<li>The "Sign In" modal form blocks submission when a mandatory field has not been completed in the required format - error message displays as intended.</li>
<li>Footer links to external websites work correctly, and open in new tabs.</li>
<li>The footer content spans the screen on larger devices, and collapses to stack on mobiles, as intended.</li>
<li>The newsletter sign up form container displays appropriately on all devices, remaining attractive and legible. The form blocks submission where any mandatory field is left unpopulated. An appropriate error message is displayed.</li>
<li>The portal registration form displays in two columns on larger screens and a single column, as intended. Content is legible and uncluttered across all devices tested.</li>
<li>The portal registration form will not submit unless all mandatory fields are completed. An error message displays as intended when triggered.</li>
<li>The contact details container displays as two columns on larger devices and one column on mobile. The content is legible and uncluttered across devices.</li>
<li>The staff profile containers display as intended on desktop, tablet, and mobile: there are three different layouts. This content needed to be resized on mobile layout to make it more legible.</li>
<li>The services containers display as intended as side by side on desktop and tablet and columnar on mobile. The content and headings are legible and attractive in all configurations.</li>
<li>The membership benefits table retains its integrity on mobile, with slightly contracted wording where required and the sacrifice of horizontal margins. Table on mobile remains legible and largely viewable without scrolling, as intended.</li>
<li>Buttons have the intended softening in colour when hovered over, as intended.</li>
<li>Page header redirects to home page on all pages</li>
</ol>

<p>All pages worked as intended on all devices. The one major change necessitated was to move the sign in button up a little in mobile mode, as I had not accounted for the screen real estate taken up by the browser elements.</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs found and resolved during development</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The indciators on the testimonials carousel were not very visible against the background</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Created style rules for the previous and next icons and gave them larger width and height properties</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The carousel text was overflowing the container on smaller screens</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Created multiple media queries to adjust the container size and font-size on smaller devices</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The sign in button was not clickable</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>After significant investigation, this turned out to be a z-index issue, with the button being 'behind' the background. Assigned the background a negative z-index property</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The modals that were edited for a dark backgorund had 'cross' close buttons that were no longer contrasted with the background and had poor visibility</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Searched Google for the issue and discovered that this can be solved by assigning the elements a CSS property of filter and a value of invert(100%)</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The text in the password reminder modal was encroaching on the submit button on mobile devices</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Inserted a br element in the text with a Bootstrap classe "d-md-none" to display the text on two lines on small and extra small devices</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The reset and submit buttons on the sign in modal were poorly aligned with the input fields on smaller screens</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Wrote various media queries for different screen sizes to fine tune the alignment</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The lack of labels on the newsletter form (by design) failed WAVE accessibility standards</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Created labels but declared that they should not be displayed, so still there for screen readers etc</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The input fields on the portal registration form were of inconsistent heights</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>This was caused by the different input types defaulting inconsistently. Wrote CSS rule with a specific height to override the defaults.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The staff photos were overflowing their containers on very large screens (tested on 1920 x 1080px)</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Wrote a media query for min-width of 1400px with a max-width property to ensure no overflow regardless of screen pixel count</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong>The Our Services page was loading slowly due to large background image file</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong>Optimised the images, making the sizes smaller.</li>
