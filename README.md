<li>Encourage users to get in touch and provide their contact details, to build a database of engaged customers</li>
<li>Provide links to the firm's social media presence</li>
</ul>

The user goals:
<ul>

<li>To test their spelling ability via the Spelling Bee game</li>
<li>To test their general knowledge and memory via the Guess the Flags game</li>
<li>To be able to find out more about Games Inc. and keep in touch with them via their social media accounts</li>
<li>To be able to get in touch with Games Inc. and contact them with their feedback</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="user-experience">User Experience</h2>

<p>The website is primarily designed for use on mobile and tablet devices, with a simple, clean layout with plenty of white
space. It is anticipated that the site's users will largely be under 16 and will tend to access it via such devices. Where
images and additional graphics have been added for larger screens, this has mainly been done to break up some of the
white space created by the additional pixels, and where the aesthetic had slipped from 'clean' to slightly 'empty'.</p>
<p>The main goals of the user experience design are to make clear immediately that this is a website offering educational
 games and to tempt users to play the games.</p>
<p>The first goal is achieved via the simple title advertising the Games Inc brand, in a typical "pixel art" style that 
users recognise as part of gaming design language, as well as the prominent welcome message. The second is achieved via bright, strong colours and cartoony imagery, 
attractive to younger users in particular, and a very clear, pared-down navigation bar offering clear access to the various games.</p>

<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Existing users in target market</li>
    <li>Potential users in target market</li>
    <li>Parents and care-providers of potential users</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-stories">User Stories</h3>
<p>
There are two main categories of user anticipated for the website: existing and potential players of the games, generally anticipated to be 14 and younger (henceforth "players"), and adults who would potentially recommend the site to children in their care (henceforth "responsible adults").

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The project's scope in its initial release is limited to the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation bar to allow users to navigate the site quickly and easily, with bold underlining to show them which page they are currently looking at.</li>
<li>A brightly coloured footer with links to the firm's social media presence.</li>
<li>A home page with a large and prominent welcome message, and a form encouraging users to contact the owners with their suggestions for future games. The form is validated by Javascript code and interfaces with the emailJS API, informing the owners
of the new message and automatically sending the user a response.</li>
<li>"Minesweeper" page with a version of the popular logic-based game, with 3 selectable difficulty levels. The page loads to a
colourful call to action to play the game. The pixel art title is decorated with different randomly coloured tiles to recall the 
appearance of a minsweeper grid, and to add vibrancy and contrast with the white space.</li>
<li>"Spelling Bee" page with a spelling contest game, with 3 selectable difficulty levels. This page accesses the Responsive 
Voice API, to "speak" the words that the user has to attempt to spell. The elements are arranged to resemble an old-fashioned
computer monitor, with the game's messages displayed as if they were the monitor's output. The whole page is decorated in a 
yellow and black "bee" aesthetic, as a pun on the spelling bee title.</li>
<li>"Guess the Flag" page with a game quizzing players on their knowledge of world flags. This page uses the Country Flags API
to access a library of flag images that is randomised and displayed on each click of the play button. Each flag has a user input
for the player to type their guess at each flag's country. The page uses a blue and green "Earth" aesthetic to match the flags theme, and the title has a fun flags motif with miniature flags adorning its letters.</li>
<li>A custom 404 "page does not exist" error page, with an error message and a prominent link to return to the home page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Features considered for later releases:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A section on the homepage with news about upcoming projects.</li>
    <li>A custom version of the minesweeper game, with users able to select the number of rows and mines.</li>
    <li>A timer on the minesweeper game showing the seconds elapsed since the start of the game.</li>
    <li>The ability for users to sign up and log in, so they can keep track of their scores and look at live leaderboards.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>The general aesthetic is colourful, retro, pixel art. It is meant to evoke 1980s video games as well as provide lots of
strong colours to appeal to younger users.</p>

<p>This design language influences every element of the site, from the bold, "pixelalted" titles, to the simple and vibrant footers, to the content of the games themselves. Almost all the colours on the website are bright and vividly contrasting with each other. Images are used sparingly - but where considered necessary to aid visual flow - have been chosen for their strong colours and cartoon aesthetic to sustain the overall appearance.</p>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

<p>In general colours were chosen for their vibrancy and their appeal to younger users, with the home page dominated by bright pinks and blues. The game pages have themed colour schemes, but always with an eye on the guiding vividness.</p>

<p>The Minesweeper page is largely dominated by the grid itself, which has a bright green checkered effect. This grid does not appear on load, but the call to action uses the same colours to keep the look consistent. The Spelling Bee page is entirely yellow and black, as a fun play on the "Bee" in the title. The Guess the Flags page similarly echoes the blue and green of Earth to tie in with its subject matter.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>Cairo from Google Fonts is used for most of the text on the website, as it seemed to mesh well with the retro style of much of the site, while itself being readable but still pleasantly informal. Roboto from Google Fonts is used for the answers in the Flags game as it used less screen space than Cairo while maintaining a similar aesthetic. Press Start 2P from Google Fonts was used for the "display" in the Spelling game, to give an old-fashioned monitor effect.</p>

<h3>Imagery</h3>

<p>The images on the website take the form of large icons on the Home page to represent the 3 available games. They were taken
from larger images and had their backgrounds removed with online software. There are also two cartoon light bulb images to decorate the call to get in touch on the homepage, and to focus the user on the form. The images on the website do not form a major part of the aesthetic and are used for emphasis of the prevailing design language.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The website has fourteen features across five pages (including a 404 error page).</p>

<h3>Current Features</h3>

<h4>Feature 1: Pixel Art Header</h4>

<p>Every page has a bespoke title using the same basic html elements but with modified CSS via Javascript code.</p>

<p>The heading-container div contains ten rows of one hundred small divs, which when coloured were designed to resemble familiar 'blocky' pixellated graphics.
These divs are coloured differently on each page to make up the title, for example spelling out 'Spelling Bee' and coloured in yellow and black stripes to resemble a
bee. Each page has its own fun and bespoke design.</p>

<p>This design is meant to be colourful and irreverent, appealing to younger users, and evocative of computer games in general.</p>

<h4>User stories covered by this feature:</h4>
<p>User story 14: as a site owner, I want players to understand what kind of games my website offers and to encourage them to try them.</p>
<p>User story 16: as a site owner, I want players to feel at home on the website and to be happy spending time there.</p>
<p>User story 17: as a site owner, I want the website to be attractive to younger users and keen gamers in particular.</p>
<p>User story 21, as a site owner, I want the games to be responsive to every kind of device.</p>

<h4>Feature 2: Navigation Bar for Desktop and Mobile</h4>

<p>Every page has a navigation bar designed to be easy to use and clearly separated from its surrounding elements.</p>

<p>To this end, a minimalist aesthetic has been employed, with no background colour, stark black type, and bold bright pink underlining for the current page.</p>

<p>For smaller screens, I chose to replace the wording with icons, but kept the basic layout rather than cluttering the design with a collapsible menu/burger-icon
combination. The colour scheme is maintained, as well as the distance from other elements. The pink underline is replaced with highlighting.</p>

<p>The navigation bar is easily accessible and almost always present on screen on both mobile and desktop, to facilitate good user experience and fast navigation.</p>

<p>User story 16: as a site owner, I want players to feel at home on the website and to be happy spending time there.</p>

<h4>Feature 3: Homepage Welcome Message</h4>

<p>The homepage features a prominent and very colourful welcome message, explaining to users what the site is for and inviting them to try its content.</p>

<p>It also prompts users to fill in the form below it if they have any suggestions for games they would like to play.</p>

<p>This is an easy and unmissable introduction to the site, easily digestible for younger users.</p>

<p>The main container is surrounded with decorative images that give visual representations of each of the games on offer. As well as being attractive, these
draw the eye to the actual message. These images are foregone on smaller screens to keep the design clean.</p>

<h4>Feature 4: Page Footer with Social Media Links</h4>

<p>Every page has a brightly coloured footer with links to Game Inc.'s social media pages.</p>

<p>Each page's footer is coloured differently to tie in with the visual language of its page. The design has deliberately been kept simple, bold, and uncluttered,
with no more information than necessary. The object is to attractively bookend the page's other content and push users towards the prominent social media links.</p>

<p>User story 14, as a site owner, I want responsible adults to feel assured that my website is a safe and rewarding place for yooung users to play, and to be happy to recommend it to them.</p>

<h4>Feature 5: Form for Submission of Users' Ideas</h4>

<p>The home page features a short form through which users can submit their suggestions for development of future games.</p>

<p>It has fields for first and last name, email address, and then a textarea for the ideas and suggestions themselves.
</p>

<p>The form calls the API emailJS to send an email to my account on submission of the form, and the emailJS template then also sends 
an automatic reply to the user, employing the details they entered where appropriate.</p>

<p>The form is validated with Javascript code, and only submits when all fields are populated, and when a correctly constituted email
address is entered in that field.</p>

<h4>Feature 6: Minesweeper Difficulty Selector</h4>

<p>The minesweeper game has a dropdown selector for three difficulty levels, prompted at the start of the game, and available at the top of the grid
throughout a round.</p>

<p>Each of the options has a predefined number of grid rows and mines, to increase or decrease the challenge as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Feature 7: Minesweeper Grid of Squares</h4>

<p>When users click on the Minesweeper "play" button, a grid of square-shaped divs is generated, with the size dependent on the
 difficulty selected.</p>

<p>The minesweeper grid size is dynamic to accommodate the difficulty selector, and adapts to all different screen sizes to display in full without scrolling.</p>

<p>The grid is styled to resemble a chekerboard/chess board, with alternate green and lighter green squares.</p>

<p>User story 21, as a site owner, I want the games to be responsive to every kind of device.</p>

<h4>Feature 8: Minesweeper Game</h4>

<p>Once a difficulty has been selected and the grid generated, the Minesweeper game is then ready to be played.</p>

<p>If the user left clicks on a square, the Javascript code will check if there is a 'mine' on that square, and if not, will run the code
to count how many mines are on the squares that surround it on the grid. It then displays that number as the square's visible content, therefore 
responding dynamically to user input. On mobile devices the click event becomes a touch event.</p>

<p>If the square that the user clicks on has squares surrounding it that contain zero mines, then the Javascript code calls a click method to 
automatically click on all of those squares, and to all subsequent squares that meet the same conditions. The player should therefore never
have to click on any square that displays "0" as its content.</p>

<p>If the user right clicks on a square, a 'flag' will be placed on that square, indicating that the user believes that a mine is on that square.
The square's responsiveness is then changed: it can no longer be left clicked on to elicit a repsonse. If the user right clicks on a square that already
contains a flag, the flag will be removed and the square returned to its original state. Hence, the right click acts as a flag on/off toggle. On mobile devices
the event is instead triggered by a long touch, of more than 300 milliseconds.</p>

<p>User story 21, as a site owner, I want the games to be responsive to every kind of device.</p>

<h4>Feature 9: Minesweeper End Games Sequences</h4>

<p>The Minesweeper game has two end of game sequences to feedback to the user and give them confirmation of their performance. One if the player
clicks on a mined square and 'loses', another if the user manages to click on every unmined square, and 'wins'.</p>

<p>The losing sequence consists of every square on the grid changing colour to either white, grey or black, randomly but in equal parts, one after another but
in random order. The mined squares change their color property to red so their location can be seen. Finally the whole grid changes to black and every
square has the 'skull' font awesome icon displayed, to unambiguously indicate the failure state.</p>

<p>The winning sequence works very similarly, but with bright colours and a joyful, 'laughing' emoji icon, again to clearly feed back to the player that
they have 'won' the game.</p>

<h4>Feature 10: Spelling Bee Game Difficulty Selector</h4>

<p>The user is presented with a drop down selector with four difficulty levels to choose between before they click on the play button.</p>

<p>Depending on the difficulty selected, the game will generate a random selection of ten words to test the user with from one of four
dictionaries of 200 words. These words then form the content of the quiz.</p>

<h4>Feature 11: Spelling Bee Game</h4>

<p>Once the difficulty has been selected, a click on the play button will generate a random array of ten words from the relevant dictionary,
and via a call to the Responsive Voice API, the device will enunciate the first word in the array.</p>

<p>The page focus is then assigned to the user input element, prompting the user to attempt to spell the word.</p>

<p>When the user either clicks on the Submit button or presses the Return key, the Javascript code checks the value of the input
against the spelling stored in the variable. If the strings are identical (the code converts the user's input to lower case) the game's display
element presents "correct!", and if not it presents "incorrect!".</p>

<p>After a brief pause, the display then shows the subsequent question number, and the Responsive Voice API is called again to speak the next
word in the array. This process repeats until all the words have been spoken to the user.</p>

<p>After the tenth submission, and the display has presented either correct or incorrect, the display then presents the user's final score.</p>

<h4>Feature 12: Spelling Bee Game Repeat and Hint Functions</h4>

<p>The Spelling Bee game features Repeat and Hint buttons.</p>

<p>The Repeat button makes a call to the Responsive Voice API and repeats the current question to the user.</p>

<p>The Hint button presents the answer to the user as the content of the game display element, but with every other letter
replaced with an asterisk. The fact that the player has asked for a hint is stored in the variable, so that if the user 
subsequently submits a correct answer, only 0.5 points are added to their total score, rather than 1 point.</p>

<h4>Feature 13: Guess the Flags Game</h4>

<p>The Guess the Flags game presents an array of ten randomly selected images of national flags from the Country Flags API.</p>

<p>On each click of the play button the array will be repopulated at random.</p>

<p>Each of the ten flags displayed is accompanied by a text input element for the user to offer their attempt at naming
the nation to which the flag belongs.</p>

<p>On clicking the submit button, the input elements are replaced with divs displaying either a tick icon for a correct answer or
a cross icon for an incorrect answer. A message below the buttons also displays the user's score and an adaptive message depending on
how well they did. The submit button also changes to a reveal button, and if that is clicked any crosses will be 
replaced by the correct answer.</p>

<h2 id="Game Instructions"></h2>

<ul>
<li>Minesweeper
<li>Choose a difficulty from the dropdown menu presented when the page loads</li>
<li>Click on the Play icon to generate the Minesweeper grid</li>
<li>You need to discover which squares have mines hidden beneath them and which don't</li>
<li>If you left-click on a square with a mine beneath it, it's game over</li>
<li>However, you need to left click on one of the squares to start the game, so pick one and take your chances</li>
<li>If you click on a square with no mine beneath it, you will be shown a number. This number represents how many of that 
square's surrounding squares contain mines. By comparing that to the number of squares you have already discover with and 
without mines, you can start 'clearing' the squares.</li>
<li>Where you are sure there is a mine, you can right click on the mouse to lay a flag as a marker. This will also prevent
you from being able to left-click on that square by accident. If you make a mistake, you can right-click on that square again
to remove the flag.</li>
<li>If you clear all the unmined squares, you win!</li>

<h3 id="device-testing">Performing tests on various devices</h3>
<h4>Devices tested:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy A7</li>
<li>HP 250 G7 laptop</li>
<li>Apple Iphone X</li>
<li>Apple Ipad Pro</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tests performed:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Page links in the navigation bar work as advertised, all links work correctly in the desktop and mobile configurations. The links to other
pages trun bright pink on hover, as intended.</li>
<li>All the buttons across all pages repsond to hover events in some way, either with a small decrease in opacity or a reversal of their color and
background-color properties.</li>
<li>The welcome message displays as intended, on both desktop and mobile and tablet configurations. The images are not displayed on smaller screens, as intended.</li>
<li>The form on the home page generates error messages when any field is missing required information. If everything is filled in correctly, a successful call to
the emailJS API is made and the notifying email is received and the automatic reply is sent.</li>
<li>The minesweeper difficulty selector works as intended, with a dropdown menu with the 3 difficulty options. The appropriate grid is then generated with a click
of the play button.</li>
<li>The three grid sizes all display as intended, across all devices tested. No scrolling is necessary at any point. On mobile devices, the biggest grid
does become slightly difficult to interact with, but this can be solved by zooming in with the hardware functionality. This is perhaps less than ideal but
perfectly workable.</li>
<li>A left click on a minesweeper square elicits the desired response. Either the square is cleared and the number of adjacent mines is displayed, or the game over sequence
begins.</li>
<li>A left click on a minesweeper square with zero adjacent mines generates the intended response: all squares with zero adjacent mines are automatically clicked in a cascading fashion,
until the code reaches squares with inner htmls of 1 or higher. No squares with a zero content need to be manually clicked.</li>
<li>A touch on the minesweeper squares in mobile configuration generates a response equivalent to a left click in desktop mode, as intended.</li>
<li>A right click on the minesweeper squares places a flag icon to signal the presense of a mine. With a flag in place, a left click on the square now returns zero response.
Another right click removes the flag. Once it has been removed, the square responds to left clicks in the same manner it would have done before the first placement of the flag.</li>
<li>A long touch on a minesweeper square in mobile configuration provides exactly the same funcitonality as a right click does in desktop configuration, as intended.</li>
<li>The placement of a flag reduces the flags in hand counter at the top of the grid by one. Removing the flag increases the counter by one. All as intended.</li>
<li>The game over sequence that is triggered on a left click of a mined square works as intended on all devices tested. A third of the squares turn white, a third, grey,
and a third black. Which squares turn which colour is randomly assigned. The order in which any of the squares turn their eventual colour is also random.
Squares changed colour one at a time, with a very small delay between each. Once all squares have changed colour, there is a small pause, and then all squares
 turn black, with red text, again as intended.</li>
<li>The game won sequence that is triggered on a left click of the last-cleared unmined square works as intended on all devices tested. A third of the squares turn yellow, a third, orange, and a third pink. Which squares turn which colour is randomly assigned. The order in which any of the squares turn their eventual colour is also random.
Squares changed colour one at a time, with a very small delay between each. Once all squares have changed colour, there is a small pause, and then all squares turn white, with 
light blue text, again as intended.</li>
<li>The spelling bee game displays as intended across all devices tested. All key elements of the game are displayed at once across all devices, as intended.</li>
<li>The spelling bee difficulty selector works as intended. The correct dictionary of words is selected from for each option.</li>
<li>The spelling bee play button starts the game as intended. The input field is given focus. The game's display element displays the number 1 to
signal the first question. The Responsive Voice API speaks the first word in the random array.</li>
<li>During the game, a click on the Submit button works as intended, passing the value of the input field for testing. A correct or incorrect message is displayed
as appropriate.</li>
<li>The answer submission process then displays the next question's number in the display element, and after a brief pause, speaks the next word.</li>
<li>The answer submission process can also be triggered by a press of the return key, as long as the input field has focus. This is as intended.</li>
<li>After ten questions are asked, the display element presents the final score. The number of correct and incorrect answers are counted correctly.</li>
<li>During the spelling bee game, a click on the Repeat button works as intended: the current question is spoken again by the Responsive Voice API.</li>
<li>During the spelling bee game, a click on the Hint button works as intended: the current question's answer is dislplayed to the user, but with
alternate letters replaced by aterisks.</li>
<li>Answers submitted correctly following the display of a hint are correctly counted as only half a point towards the final score.</li>
<li>The Guess the Flag (GTF) game loads correcly on all devices, with the large round Play button prominently displayed near the centre of all screens.
The element responds to a cursor hover with the display of a lighter blue 'halo' effect, as intended.</li>
<li>The GTF play button responds as intended: ten random flags are displayed with associated input fields to return answers. The first input field is provided focus.</li>
<li>A click on the GTF Submit button checks all answers provided in the input fields. An incorrectly returned input field is replaced with a div displaying a red
cross/times icon. A correctly returned input field is replaced with a div displaying a green tick icon.</li>
<li>The click on the GTF Submit button displays the user's score, and a dynamic message dependent on that score.</li>
<li>Finally, the click on the GTF submit button changes the button's wording to 'Reveal', as intended.</li>
<li>A click on the GTF Reveal button replaces any red cross/times icon with the actual correct answer.</li>
<li>A click on the GTF Play Again button returns all elements to their original state, and generates a new array of random flags.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs found and resolved during development</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Guess the Flag: used a for loop to try to populate an array of 10 unique random numbers, was falling short when numbers duplicated</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Used a while loop instead, so the loop was infinite until the array's length was 10</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Guess the Flag: the new game button swaps out the answer div elements for input fields, but this presented as a very brief 'spasm'
effect on screen, with the content being pulled down to the bottom of the page.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Used an overlaying blank div that would display instead with a breif timeout, so that the effect was hidden by a simple blank screen.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Minesweeper: struggled to get the right click event working with normal Javascript.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Used Jquery mousedown method and a swtich case with case 3 being the right mouse button.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Minesweeper: the squares were still not clickable as the default event was generating the normal menu</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Added oncontext menu attribute to #grid element to prevent the behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Minesweeper: the squares' inner html (ie the numbers to be displayed on a click) could be displayed by dragging the cursor across them
and highlighting the text.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Added CSS property of user-select: none to each square</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Minesweeper: tried to replace the right click event with a long click event for touch screen devices, but the code did not work.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Used touchstart and touchend events instead.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Minesweeper: the long touch event was interfering with the normal touch event, and was often triggering the latter as well as the former.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Used a setTimeout function to remove the regular touch event handler for a very brief period after a long touch event had been triggered.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Minesweeper: the code to automatically click on squares with an inner HMTL of '0' was creating an infinite loop and crashing the browser.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> The function was clicking on squares with a certain identifying class forever, so for each simulated click I added a new class to the clicked
element and added a condition to the main click event handler to only run if 'this' did not have a class list that contained that newly-assigned class name.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Minesweeper: the automating code was clicking on all the squares with the class 'clciked-square-radius', which was actually all the 
squares surrounding every square that had already been clicked on.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> On each new click of a square, removed the class 'clicked-square-radius' from ALL squares, so that only the squares surrounding the last-clicked
square would be addressed by the automating code.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Minesweeper: removing the 'clicked-square-radius' class from each square meant that only the first of any of the surrounding squares was being
automatically clicked on, because the 'memory' of which squares to click was being lost on each simulated click.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> In place of the general 'clicked-square-radius' class, used a template literal to add a class to each surrounding square that referred to 
the clicked square's id, and redirected the automating code to click on squares with classes that contain its id.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Spelling Bee: the game was not iterating through the array of words but was speaking the first word repeatedly</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> On each submission of an answer, increased the value of the currentQuestion variable by 1 and passed it as a parameter
to the speak function, to stand for the iteration of the randomWords array to be passed to the Responsive Voice API.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Spelling Bee: the Hint function was not displaying the answer as intended, with aternate letters replaced by askterisks.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Used the split method to convert the answers into arrays that can be iterated over.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Spelling Bee: difficulty selector was not working</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Added a "change" event listener to the select element, and to generate a new list of random words on each change.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Home page: the images decorating the welcome message and form were distorting the layout in various configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Rewrote the html to utilise the Bootstrap grid system to provide a much more robust layout across all device types.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Home page: the form was submitting and calling emailJS even if the names submitted contained numbers and special characters.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Added the letters variable to define which characters were considered valid, and then used the match method to verify that
the values of those inputs adhered to that varaible.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Home page: the footer had very small gutters at either side so wasn't quite spanning the whole viewport.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Wrote a CSS rule for the body element, with a min-width property of 100vw</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Validation: had several duplicated id attributes on home page caused by the duplication of code for the mobile/tablet layout.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Assigned a 'mobile' suffix to the appropriate ids and updated the CSS code as necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Validation: had lots of missing text content for links where icons had been used.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Assigned the anchor elements with text inside spans, and assigned the spans CSS of display:none.</li>
</ul>

<h3>External Libraries</h3>

<h4>Bootstrap v4.13</h4>
<p>Bootstrap's grid system was used to facilitate a robust and responsive layout for the Home page, because
exact positioning of the images in three rows either side of the welcome message was proving difficult with my own CSS rules.</p>

<h4>Jquery v3.6</h4>
<p>Jquery was used to facilitate the right click event handling for the Minesweeper game, as doing so with ordinary Javascript
was proving difficult.</p>
